summary: |
    A passionate polyglot full-stack developer and Solution Architect with over 25 years of development experience, specializing in scalable, high-performant cloud solutions across diverse industries. I've led the architecture and development of numerous cloud-based projects, notably an Azure integration project for an Australian government organization that had to handle vast volumes of streaming data, which needed to be accurately ingested and reported on, with life-critical implications. This involved meeting demanding throughput requirements, while ensuring all functional and remaining non-functional requirements are met.<br><br>

    I'm deeply passionate about cloud technologies and continually striving to enhance my knowledge and skills in this field, as demonstrated by the numerous certifications I've earned across both Azure and AWS. I've built DevOps pipelines for the projects I've worked on, including those that provision all necessary cloud resources (via Infrastructure-as-Code), as well as pipelines for building, testing, and deploying developed applications. Throughout, ensuring adherence to the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework, delivering secure, reliable, performant, cost-effective, and resilient systems. Most of my experience has been in software development, where I adhere to a TDD approach that fosters decoupled, testable, and maintainable SOLID code.<br><br>
