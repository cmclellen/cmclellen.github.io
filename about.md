[Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/0BwRF9_HwsNHNUW9ZcWNJb1p3LTlDck1MeWx3WXJrVC1lN2VF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104807125876702347246&resourcekey=0-7eD83yMf26Hpbxo8JWND5Q&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 20 years experience across multiple industries. Confident in working at all levels with the client (both technical and non-technical) and able to translate complex designs into simpler, more scalable solutions, while ensuring predictable outcomes. I have been involved at all aspects of the SDLC from design, development, testing, build and deployment. I’ve mostly worked in agile environments where either Scrum or Kanban methodologies have been used.

I've developed backends in C#.NET, NodeJs & Python, but also have a fair amount of experience developing frontends (mostly using Angular, but have experience working with React too). I have a keen interest in everything microservices (scalability, high availability, long running processes, sagas, etc.), of which I have had a fair amount of experience developing. TDD is something I've engrained into my development process, giving me that confidence that as the system evolves, existing functionality still operates as expected.

I’ve been involved in several cloud-based projects across both Azure and AWS, from developing serverless applications, migrating large database solutions from on-premises to PaaS services, developed web apps (Angular & React), etc. I was involved in settings up CICD DevOps pipelines for these projects, whether it was using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions, and also developed IaC scripts (Terraform & Bicep) to provision resources across various environments.
