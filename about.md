[Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/0BwRF9_HwsNHNUW9ZcWNJb1p3LTlDck1MeWx3WXJrVC1lN2VF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104807125876702347246&resourcekey=0-7eD83yMf26Hpbxo8JWND5Q&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Passionate full-stack developer and software architect with over 25 years of experience implementing scalable and performant solutions across various industries. I've had the privelege to work on projects that have pushed the boundaries of design and what constitutes well architected systems, where careful consideration of both the functional and non-functional requirements was paramount in delivering these solutions.

My notable achievements have been leading the architecture and development of 2 large Azure integration projects for 2 different Australian government organizations that I was a part of, each with their own varying degrees of complexities in terms of throughput, security and monitoring requirements. I got to work with vast quanities of data at scale using services like Azure Event Hubs and Azure Data Explorer; vast volumes of GPS coordinates where  streamed through at a constant rate and there was little margin for any loss.

I have significant experience working across various languages and frameworks, helping teams translate business requirements to technical specifications and while doing so, oftentimes identify areas for improvement that result in streamlined processes (not just for the end users/stakeholders, but also for the various processes within the SDLC, helping reduce that feedback loop to deliver a quality product quicker). Having had quite a bit of Dev(Sec)Ops experience, most of the projects I've been involved with has required setting up CICD pipelines (predominantly in Azure DevOps & Github) and helping with the Bicep/Terraform IaC code to provision required cloud resources needed by the workloads deployed, while also ensuring the actual workloads are deployed (which includes building the code, running the automated tests, reporting code coverage, etc.). Scrum and Kanban are typical with the engagements I've been involved with.

I've a keen interest in cloud technologies, which has led me to obtain both my Azure Solution Architect Expert and AWS Solution Architect Professional certifications, along with about 8 other cloud certifcations (mostly Azure related). In my spare time, I'm either studying for my next cert, dabling with new tech (https://cmclellen.github.io/), or helping with a Umbraco CMS site I developed and maintain for my church (https://stbrigidsmidland.com.au/).
