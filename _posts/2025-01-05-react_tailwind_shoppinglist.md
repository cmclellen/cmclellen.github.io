### Background
I wanted to experiment a bit with using Supabase as the backing store for a React developed Shopping List web app I created. You can try it out by logging in to the <a href="https://ez-shopping-list.vercel.app/" target="_blank">web app</a> using the email `test@user.com` with password `testuser`.
